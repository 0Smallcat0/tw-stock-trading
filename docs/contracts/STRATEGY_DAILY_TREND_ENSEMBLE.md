# Strategy Contract: Daily Trend Ensemble (TW Edition)

Status: TW Core MVP strategy contract (Goal TW-A adoption; carried from the crypto edition with TW amendments)
Evidence basis: `docs/research/TW_SIGNAL_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md` (2026-07-03)

## Purpose

`Daily Trend Ensemble` converts one asset's closed DAILY candles (Taipei close)
into one auditable target-exposure decision per trading day. It is a long-only,
time-series trend rule: trend up → hold, trend down → cash.

It does not submit orders, choose final position size in TWD terms, inspect
account state, or bypass risk.

Plain language:

```text
每個交易日收盤看一次：還原價站在幾條長短均線上方，就持有幾分之幾。
四條都站上 → 滿額。全部跌破 → 空手。中間就是 25% 一階的階梯。
```

## Value Proposition (TW-specific, pre-registered)

The crypto edition's evidence ("daily MA rules beat buy-and-hold after costs")
does NOT transfer to Taiwan. The registered claim for this contract is:

```text
PRIMARY CLAIM — drawdown reduction, explicitly NOT return enhancement:
  MaxDD(strategy) <= 60% x MaxDD(0050 total-return buy-and-hold)
  AND CAGR(strategy) >= CAGR(0050 total-return buy-and-hold) - 3pp
  after full costs, on dividend-adjusted series, idle-cash yield 0%
  (sensitivity rerun at 1.5%).
```

The mandatory benchmark is 0050 buy-and-hold with dividends reinvested (the
TWSE total-return index is the secondary reference). Comparisons against the
price-only TAIEX are void: the dividend wedge is ~3.5-4%/yr since 2003.

If the registered backtest plus holdout cannot satisfy both conditions, the
honest verdict is "Taiwan gets buy-and-hold, not this signal" — a FAIL report
is a successful outcome of the process.

## Why An Ensemble (design rationale)

- Which single lookback is best is an in-sample artifact; the ensemble spreads
  single-parameter selection risk across four lookbacks and keeps the
  registered trial count N minimal (one strategy, zero tunable lookbacks).
- Fractional ladder sizing (vs binary all-in/all-out) halves the cost of
  whipsaw regimes — the dominant TW failure mode (2010-2016 sideways,
  2023-2026 melt-up with V-shaped crash interruptions).

## Inputs

- Per-asset daily closed candles (Taipei close), from the public data layer.
- Signal input series: DIVIDEND/SPLIT-ADJUSTED closes (the adjustment pipeline
  contract lives in `docs/contracts/DATA_ADAPTER_TWSE.md`). Raw closes feed
  accounting and display, never SMA computation — otherwise every ex-dividend
  day is a false trend break.
- Warmup: no decision until at least `200` daily closes are available.
- All values `Decimal`; all timestamps UTC-aware (Taipei close = 05:30 UTC).

Required derived features (from the feature pipeline, closed candles only):

- `sma_20`, `sma_65`, `sma_150`, `sma_200`: arithmetic means of the last
  N adjusted daily closes, computed at close `t` using closes `<= t`.

## Signal Construction (contract-fixed)

Sub-signals at daily close `t` (adjusted close):

```text
s_n = 1 if adj_close_t > sma_n(t) else 0,  for n in {20, 65, 150, 200}
```

Target exposure fraction:

```text
exposure_fraction = (s_20 + s_65 + s_150 + s_200) / 4
                  ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00}
```

Boundary rule: `adj_close_t == sma_n(t)` counts as NOT above (`s_n = 0`).
Conservative by construction.

The four lookbacks `{20, 65, 150, 200}` are FIXED BY THIS CONTRACT and uniform
across all assets. Changing any lookback, adding a lookback, adding hysteresis
bands, or per-asset tuning is a new strategy variant: it requires
pre-registration in the trial registry and a new or amended contract. This is
an anti-overfitting rule, not a style choice.

## Output

Each decision contains only:

- `symbol`
- `exposure_fraction`: `Decimal` in `{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}`
- `sub_signals`: the four `s_n` states
- `score`: equals `exposure_fraction` (kept for pipeline compatibility)
- `reason_codes`
- `generated_at_bar_close`: the daily close timestamp (UTC)
- `executable_from_next_bar`: strictly after `generated_at_bar_close`
  (in practice: the next TRADING day's open)

Reason codes:

| Condition | Code |
| --- | --- |
| `adj_close > sma_20` | `ABOVE_SMA_20` else `BELOW_SMA_20` |
| `adj_close > sma_65` | `ABOVE_SMA_65` else `BELOW_SMA_65` |
| `adj_close > sma_150` | `ABOVE_SMA_150` else `BELOW_SMA_150` |
| `adj_close > sma_200` | `ABOVE_SMA_200` else `BELOW_SMA_200` |
| fraction increased vs previous decision | `LADDER_UP` |
| fraction decreased vs previous decision | `LADDER_DOWN` |
| fraction unchanged | `LADDER_HOLD` |

With fewer than 200 daily closes NO decision is produced: the feature layer
emits no snapshot, and the runtime records a `WARMUP_INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY`
health event instead of a strategy decision.

## Ladder-Change Semantics (what triggers a notification)

- A notification event exists only when `exposure_fraction` changes between
  consecutive decisions for the same symbol.
- The event magnitude is the delta (usually 0.25; multi-cross days may produce
  0.50 or more in one step).
- No change → no notification. Long silences are correct behavior.

## Relationship To Other Layers

- The strategy emits a FRACTION of the asset's risk budget, never a TWD amount.
- Portfolio maps `exposure_fraction × asset_risk_budget` to target weights
  (TW Core MVP budget: 0050 at 100%; see `docs/contracts/UNIVERSE_CONTRACT.md`).
- Risk gate approval is still required for every resulting action; the strategy
  cannot bypass it.
- The paper broker executes approved actions on the scoreboard account at the
  NEXT TRADING DAY's open; the human executes them (or not) at their broker,
  manually.

## Safety Rules

- Long-only: `exposure_fraction` is never negative; SHORT is unrepresentable.
- Decisions use only closed daily candles; still-open sessions never enter.
- A decision generated at close `t` is executable no earlier than the next
  trading day.
- Deterministic: identical candle history → identical decision.
- Public data only; no account, order, or broker state may be read.

## Caveats (documented honestly, from the research)

- 0050 is ~57-64% TSMC (2025-26): "index timing" is materially a single-stock
  trend rule on 2330 plus a diversified tail, and it correlates with the
  global AI cycle.
- Under the ±10% daily price limit, exits signaled on a limit-down day may
  execute into further declines (2025-04-07: 0050's first-ever limit-down
  close; the crash spread over three sessions, ~-18%).
- The current regime (V-shaped crashes inside a melt-up, 2023-2026) is the
  WORST regime for this rule. This is known and accepted at registration time.

## Explicitly Out Of Scope (requires pre-registered research)

- Hysteresis/band variants; Donchian ensemble variant
- Regime filters; stop overlays
- 2330 or any additional asset (2330 is excluded by evidence — see universe
  contract)
- Same-day execution via the 14:00-14:30 fixed-price session (execution-timing
  experiment, not MVP)
